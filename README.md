# Precisly 🧭✨

> **Project status:** Experimental / alpha Android WebView browser. Core browsing, vault, downloads, and PDF features are implemented, but public production release requires successful CI/device testing, closed beta feedback, and independent security review. Do not describe this app as a fully audited secure browser or password-manager replacement yet.


**Precisly** is an experimental, feature-rich mobile web browser tailored for Android. Built from the ground up using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **Material Design 3 (M3)**, Precisly combines lightweight, swift browsing pipelines with powerful productivity portals, such as an encrypted local Password Vault, a range-capable Download Manager, a built-in PDF Viewer, and a comprehensive **AI Chat Hub**.

## 🎨 Creative Identity & Brand Design

- **App Name**: `Precisly`
- **Visual Logo Philosophy**: An elegant, modernized abstract monogram of the letter **E** swept towards the east like a swift arrow, transitioning dynamically into a glossy cyan and deep blue digital wind rose. The design represents forward alignment, navigation, and state-of-the-art tech.
- **Aesthetic Direction**: Highly colorful, tactile, and immersive dark visual themes with generous negative space, active Material Design 3 ripple effects, elegant card frames, customized iconography, and crisp responsive styling.

## 🚀 Key Architectural Features

### 1. Multi-Tab Management Engine 🗂️
* Fully responsive navigation bar supporting live previews, dynamic creation, switching, and closing of multiple parallel browser instances.
* Live tracking of active session tab histories, title retrieval, and background session states.
* Supports customized simulation behaviors, such as **Incognito Mode** (private sandboxed sessions that avoid caching history or site state).

### 2. AI Chat Explorer & Workspace Hub ✨
* Quick-access launcher dialog for modern virtual assistants, accessed via the toolbar's sparkle icon (`Icons.Default.AutoAwesome`).
* Supported pre-configured AI providers:
  - **Google Gemini** (Deep reasoning, writing companion & Google workspace tools)
  - **OpenAI ChatGPT** (Industry leader in general messaging & memory features)
  - **Anthropic Claude** (Articulate precision, writing, and intensive software engineering)
  - **DeepSeek Chat** (Speedy deep reasoning and logic processing with DeepSeek-R1 logic engines)
  - **Microsoft Copilot** (Enterprise productivity and grounded search citations)
  - **Perplexity AI** (Source-cited modern search engines providing concise reports)
  - **HuggingChat** (Community-sourced open-weights sandbox ecosystem)
* Smart search capabilities allowing instant catalog searches, fast filtering via multi-select categories (e.g. *Multimodal*, *Research*, *General*, *Logic & Code*, *Open Source*), and direct quick actions to load the AI assistant either **in the current tab** or **in a new tab**.

### 3. Customizable Search Pattern Engine 🔍
* Dynamic routing of address-bar queries. Offers an advanced **Default Query URL Pattern** text controller matching exact custom query formats.
* Custom provider formats can use `%s` as a search-query wildcard (e.g., `https://myCustomSearchEngine.com/q=%s`).
* Integrated search provider presets automatically updated via the settings selection dropdown, including *DuckDuckGo*, *Google*, *Bing*, *Yahoo*, *Brave*, *Ecosia*, *Yandex*, and *Baidu*.

### 4. Advanced Security & Productivity Suites 🔒
* **Password Vault Screen**: Client-side credential manager using local AES-GCM encryption; independent audit still required before production use.
* **Integrated Download Manager**: A utility that supports normal downloads and range-based chunk downloads when servers allow it, progress tracking, pause/resume attempts, and direct download states.
* **Embedded PDF Viewer Screen**: Inline PDF document reader based on Android PdfRenderer for HTTPS PDFs cached locally (`lite://pdf?url=...`).
* **Bookmarks & History Screens**: Interactive cataloging systems with custom folder labeling, category icons, search indexing, and bulk cleaning utilities.

## 🛠️ Technological Stack & Libraries

- **Programming Language**: 100% Modern [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- **UI Framework**: [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for fully declarative, responsive, and tactile layouts.
- **Dependency & Design System**: [Material Design 3 (M3)](https://m3.material.io/) including fluid component guidelines, adaptive `WindowInsets` handling, dynamic ColorSchemes (including dark/light dynamic variations), and `Elevation` spacing.
- **State Management**: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) utilizing Android `ViewModel`, Kotlin Coroutines, and strict reactive `StateFlow` structures for error/loading states.
- **Integration Capabilities**:
  - `Chromium WebView` integrations for high-speed page parsing and script execution.
  - Direct local configurations for configuring varying *User Agent* signatures (providing compatibility for desktop-mode and legacy configurations).

## ✨ Summary of UX Best Practices Used

- **Accessibiltity first**: Every visual asset, descriptive badge, active button, and search input fields include contextual `contentDescription` mappings to support TalkBack and standard screen reader assistance.
- **Standardized Touch targets**: All active elements, including custom back/forward navigators, tabs, password reveal tools, and AI launcher actions support a minimum touch area footprint of **48dp x 48dp** to facilitate seamless mobile touch feedback.
- **Clean State Boundaries**: Prototype screens should avoid fake or dead-end elements; remaining limitations are tracked in docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md. The Password Vault, History log, custom Search pattern editor, and AI workspace list represent live functional services tied directly to ViewModel reactive flows.
- **Responsive Sizing**: Explicit fluid layout guidelines avoiding hardcoded container widths. Custom flow layers (`FlowRowLayout`) are designed dynamically to wrap shortcut badges gracefully across compact, medium, and wide landscape devices.
